## Recommendation

- Weekly/monthly sales trend should be monitored frequently in order to know customers' most ordered pizza types and categories.
- Promotions and discounts should be made available for undersold pizza types and sizes to create more awareness to the customers.
- Understand the customers' demographics through their preferences on the pizzas ordered.
- Special discounts should be offered on the most sold pizza type which is the classic pizza and the most sold pizza size which is the Large-sized pizza. This is to increase sales and returns by 100%.
